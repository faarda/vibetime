// desktop tracking silently until someone re-runs `vibe hooks install`.
//
// Two rules keep this from being hostile. It only ever repairs an install that
// already exists, so a machine that never ran `vibe init` is untouched. And it
// respects deliberate removals recorded in config, so `vibe uninstall` stays
// uninstalled instead of reappearing on the next session.
